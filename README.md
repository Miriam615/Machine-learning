Machine learning studies and models


### Supervised learning
- **Description**: Learn model based on definition/already grouped data
- **Regression**: there's numerical relation between dependent variable and independent variable
  - **Linear regression**:
    - **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: [View Repository](https://github.com/Miriam615/Machine-learning/blob/main/Linear%20regression)
    - **Partial Least Squares (PLS)**: [View Repository](https://github.com/Miriam615/Machine-learning/blob/main/Linear%20regression)
    - **Ridge Regression**: 
  - **Logistic regression**:[View Repository](https://github.com/Miriam615/Machine-learning/blob/main/logistic%20regression)
  - 
- **Classification**: there's different groups
- **How do I know which model to choose?**: [View Repository](https://github.com/Miriam615/Machine-learning/blob/main/how%20to%20select%20model)

### Unsupervised learning
- **Description**: Let machine learn based on similarities of unknown data
